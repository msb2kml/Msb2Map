The Android mechanism of messages broadcasting is used between
the driving application and Msb2And. This is an asynchronous
mechanism permitting the simultaneous functioning of the 2 applications.  
This mean that the data could be send directly or progressively.

There is a possible handshaking at the starting of the application.

See the **Protocol** file for the details.
