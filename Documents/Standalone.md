This application could be launched directly however its
capabilities are then quite limited.  
The map is shown centered at the same location as the previous
usage and with the same zoom level.

If the file .../Msblog/StartGPS.gpx exists, the waypoints that it
contains are displayed. This is a file used for the applications
Msb2And and Msb2Kml.
