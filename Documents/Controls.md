# Map movement

The map could be moved by the driving application but the user
has some control.  
Panning the map is done by touching the screen and moving the finger.
When two fingers are touching the screen, the zoom level is
changed by pinching or widening, the orientation of the map is
modified by twisting.

The application does not respond to a change of orientation of the device.

# Quitting
There is a button on the lower right corner of the screen to exit
the application and return to the driving application.

# Information
There is an information field on the left of the exit button. Its
content is specified by the driving application.

# Waypoints
Taping on a waypoint (diabolo marker) shows a bubble with the
information (usually the name) associated to this location by the
driving application. Taping on the bubble hide it.

# Picking
There is a document specific to this processing.
